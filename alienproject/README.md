Concept and Mechanics

Concept: A classic space shooter game where the player controls a hero at the bottom of the screen, firing at waves of aliens. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score by eliminating as many aliens as possible. The game is endless, with no levels, but the difficulty increases progressively with the appearance of a boss at regular intervals.

Mechanics:

Controls: The player moves the hero horizontally at the bottom of the screen and shoots at the aliens descending from the top.

Special Shots: For every 15 aliens eliminated, the player gains 3 bursts of special shots, pressing B.

Meteors: Indestructible meteors fall periodically, adding an extra challenge to the gameplay.

Boss: A powerful boss appears for the first time when the player reaches 100 points and subsequently every 200 points (100, 300, 500, etc.). The boss requires 5 hits to be defeated.

Scoring: The player accumulates points for each alien eliminated. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score.

Endless: The game has no defined ending. The player continues playing until defeated.
